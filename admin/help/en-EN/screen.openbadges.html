<h1>JomBadger</h1>
<p>Detailed help is in JomBadger's wiki. You are invited to participate to this wiki ;-).</p>
<p>This page is only a quick help.</p>

<p>After JomBadger is installed, first thing to do is to create a badges' catégory, than a badge. You can also complete the parameters. But before going further in the user interface, you have to get all the badge's ressources.</p>
<p>You have to find an image for your badge, think about the criterias to win the badge and of course its name.</p>
<p>Than, write an article in Joomla! with all thode elements. You will need this article's url.</p>
<p>Finaly, you can create your first badge in the user interface from JomBadger.</p>
<p>How to issue a badge :</p>
<ul>
<li>the player does some actions that you tell him to do (you have to code these actions). JomBadger will soon offer some possibilities to create actions without code</li>
<li>If criterias are validated, his badge can be generated. At this moment, your code has to insert the email and the badge's id in the ob_validate table</li>
<li>Player is than redirected to the page "Get a badge". It creates the badge only if the criterias are validated (cf previous point). This page issues the badge and saves it in the database, than ask if you want to push it to your backpack</li>
</ul>
